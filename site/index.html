		<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Coronaviruses are a group of RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.</p>

        <p>Coronaviruses are members of the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.[5][4] They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.[6] The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses.[7] They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.</p>

		<h2>Origin</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000 BCE, although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million years or more, implying long term coevolution with bat and avian species.[74] The most recent common ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has been placed at about 2400 BCE, of the betacoronavirus line at 3300 BCE, of the gammacoronavirus line at 2800 BCE, and of the deltacoronavirus line at about 3000 BCE. Bats and birds, as warm-blooded flying vertebrates, are an ideal natural reservoir for the coronavirus gene pool (with bats the reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronavirus – and birds the reservoir for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses). The large number and global range of bat and avian species that host viruses has enabled extensive evolution and dissemination of coronaviruses</p>

		<p>Many human coronaviruses have their origin in bats.[76] The human coronavirus NL63 shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (ARCoV.2) between 1190 and 1449 CE.[77] The human coronavirus 229E shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (GhanaGrp1 Bt CoV) between 1686 and 1800 CE.[78] More recently, alpaca coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E diverged sometime before 1960.[79] MERS-CoV emerged in humans from bats through the intermediate host of camels.[80] MERS-CoV, although related to several bat coronavirus species, appears to have diverged from these several centuries ago.[81] The most closely related bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV diverged in 1986.[82] A possible path of evolution of SARS coronavirus and keen bat coronaviruses is that SARS-related coronaviruses coevolved in bats for a long time. The ancestors of SARS-CoV first infected leaf-nose bats of the genus Hipposideridae; subsequently, they spread to horseshoe bats in the species Rhinolophidae, then to Asian palm civets, and finally to humans.</p>

		<p>Unlike other betacoronaviruses, bovine coronavirus of the species Betacoronavirus 1 and subgenus Embecovirus is thought to have originated in rodents and not in bats.[76][85] In the 1790s, equine coronavirus diverged from the bovine coronavirus after a cross-species jump.[86] Later in the 1890s, human coronavirus OC43 diverged from bovine coronavirus after another cross-species spillover event.[87][86] It is speculated that the flu pandemic of 1890 may have been caused by this spillover event, and not by the influenza virus, because of the related timing, neurological symptoms, and unknown causative agent of the pandemic.[88] Besides causing respiratory infections, human coronavirus OC43 is also suspected of playing a role in neurological diseases.[89] In the 1950s, the human coronavirus OC43 began to diverge into its present genotypes.[90] Phylogentically, mouse hepatitis virus (Murine coronavirus), which infects the mouse's liver and central nervous system,[91] is related to human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus. Human coronavirus HKU1, like the aforementioned viruses, also has its origins in rodents.</p>

		<h2>Symptoms</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.</p>
        <ul>
			<li>Most common symptoms:
				<ul>
					<li>fever</li>
					<li>dry cough</li>
					<li>tiredness</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Less common symptoms:
				<ul>
					<li>aches and pains</li>
					<li>sore throat</li>
					<li>diarrhoea</li>
					<li>conjunctivitis</li>
					<li>headache</li>
					<li>loss of taste or smell</li>
					<li>a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Serious symptoms:
				<ul>
					<li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
					<li>chest pain or pressure</li>
					<li>loss of speech or movement</li>
				</ul>
			</strong></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility.
People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.
On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.</p>

		<h2>Prevention and Treatmeant</h2>
		<hr>
		<img src="https://westfootcare.com/custom/images/stopspread.jpg" align="right">
		<p>
			There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. Treatment is only supportive. A number of antiviral targets have been identified such as viral proteases, polymerases, and entry proteins. Drugs are in development which target these proteins and the different steps of viral replication. A number of vaccines using different methods are also under development for different human coronaviruses.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are no antiviral drugs to treat animal coronaviruses.[citation needed] Vaccines are available for IBV, TGEV, and Canine CoV, although their effectiveness is limited. In the case of outbreaks of highly contagious animal coronaviruses, such as PEDV, measures such as destruction of entire herds of pigs may be used to prevent transmission to other herds.
